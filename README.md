# MPIprimesearch

MPI program designed to use a cluster of machines to search for how many prime numbers there are within a number range and display the highest prime number found.

Written in C++ with OpenMPI

I have written a guide on how to setup and install SSH - OpenBLAS - NFS and HPL benchmark program in Ubuntu server 18.04 x86_64.

Once HPL is setup and confirmed working, MPIprimesearch will be ready to run using your own settings for your cluster.
